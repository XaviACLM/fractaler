# fractaler
A simple (very slow) raytracing/marching engine. The interesting bit about it is the capacity to (very, very slowly) render (not-necessarily-self-similar) fractal-like objects. Check out this bumpy ball:

With ray-marching and some ingenuity, it's not hard to figure out how to take any rough "terrain" and map it into a sphere (...or plane). Surely there are better ways to do this, but I find the concept/result kind of interesting.

This project was built while loosely following along with the course "Gràfics i Visualizació de Dades" from the computer science degree @ Universitat de Barcelona. I say following along because I wasn't taking the course --- for whatever reason, it isn't among the electives that can be taken as a math major.
